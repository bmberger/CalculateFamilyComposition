# CalculateFamilyComposition

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The purpose of this program is to read data from an input file, tally up number of pairs, & display frequencies of family composition.

WHAT I LEARNED: At one point in my code, I was confused: why am I getting more families than I have? The answer was that I was counting each enter and not just family. So, I had to place the counter in each family if statement (I could have also did an umbrella if statement to make sure there was text and then put the family counter within that.)

WHAT I DID WELL: I really enjoyed testing for the specific pairing and counting each up.
